# Sudoku Solver

# Introduction:
Sudoku is a logic-based number puzzle that gained immense popularity globally in the late 20th century. Its origins can be traced back to Switzerland and its modern version evolved from the mathematical concept of Latin squares. Sudoku puzzles are typically presented as a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 subgrids.

# Rules:
The objective of Sudoku is to fill the 9x9 grid so that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids (also called "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle starts with some cells already filled in with numbers; these are the "givens." The player's task is to fill in the remaining cells while adhering to the following rules:

Each row must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each column must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

# How to Play:
Start with a partially filled 9x9 grid.
Fill the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
Use logic and deduction to determine the correct placement of numbers.
The puzzle is solved when the entire grid is filled correctly.


# Overview of the AI-based Sudoku Solver:

The provided AI-based Sudoku solver is a Python program implemented using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and backtracking algorithm for solving puzzles. It offers functionalities for solving existing Sudoku puzzles and generating new ones.

# How the Solver Works:

The solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm to recursively explore possible solutions for the Sudoku puzzle. It systematically places numbers in empty cells while ensuring that the placement adheres to the rules of Sudoku. If a conflict arises, indicating an invalid placement, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number. This process continues until a valid solution is found or until all possibilities are exhausted.

The solver also includes a puzzle generator feature. It starts with a fully solved Sudoku puzzle and randomly removes a certain number of cells to create a new puzzle. To ensure the generated puzzle has a unique solution, it verifies the uniqueness of the solution by solving the modified puzzle.


# Features of the Application:
Solver: Allows users to input a Sudoku puzzle and solves it using a backtracking algorithm. 

Generator: Generates a new Sudoku puzzle for users to solve. 

GUI Interface: Provides a user-friendly graphical interface using Tkinter, making it easy to interact with the Sudoku puzzles.
