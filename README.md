Each row must contain all digits from 1 to 9 with no repetition.
Each column must contain all digits from 1 to 9 with no repetition.
Each of the nine 3x3 subgrids must contain all digits from 1 to 9 with no repetition.

# How to Play:
Start with a partially filled 9x9 grid.
Fill the grid so that each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.
Use logic and deduction to determine the correct placement of numbers.
